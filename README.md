# Introduction
I created this project to showcase my skills in React and meet the requirements for the Frontend Developer role. The goal was to build a responsive dashboard using React and additional libraries, following the provided design.
<br />
To accomplish this, I utilized:
<br />
Vite - For quick project setup and development<br />
React - As the primary UI library to build components<br />
Tailwind CSS - For utility-first styling and rapid development<br />
React Chart.js - To display dynamic charts<br />
React Router - For routing between pages<br />
React Icons - For easily adding icons to the UI<br />
I structured the project using features and pages as the main organization. This allows for encapsulated code and easier extensibility. The focus was on building reusable components, handling responsive design, and integrating with mock API data.
<br />
Overall this project demonstrates my skills in React, component architecture, responsive design, and integrating third-party libraries. I enjoyed working on it and look forward to discussing further.
